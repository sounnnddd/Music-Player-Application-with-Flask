# Music-Player-Application-with-Flask
Online music player application (only front-end) deployed with the Flask framework.
** This project deals with an online music player run in a web page that is created for artists and for the listeners who use this application.**
A comprehensive study of the application has been done and the SRS document created for the music player application. The code has been implemented with fewer functionalities than that has been discussed in the SRS document.

## This repository consists of the following:
1. **hello_flask** : The code for the music player application that is deployed with the Flask framework.
2. **soundarya_Documentation** : SRS document along with static, dynamic models, and Test Case documentation.
3. **soundarya_PPT** : Overview on the project along with screenshots of the output

To run the code:
The code is run in VSCode in a Python Virtual Environment. Move to app.py and run the program. Click on the link displayed on the terminal to be directed to the webpage. Pretty much it!
